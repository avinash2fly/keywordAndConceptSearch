```> ./a3search simple simple.idx "flora"```

## explanation:

./a3search -> executable object file

simple -> name of the folder where the files are located

Note : files should be in xml, txt, html format. should not be binary format

simple.idx -> folder name (any name), it creates the index of the file in this folder

"flora" -> searching keyword

Note : you can add multiple keyword and the result will be the 'and' condition of the output. i.e list of files containing both the keyword.
